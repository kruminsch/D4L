Internship Task
Binary name "my_mailer".
This program reads the e-mail addresses from a huge text file. And fakes e-mail sending by waiting for half a second. Assuming that there are valid addresses in the list, separated by a new line. Please pass a short "mailing message" as a first arg and a path to the mailing_list_file(txt) as a second. You could also run ./gen to create a testing list of 1000000 entries.
